Operators:
    Operators are different symbols that we can to perform operations like addition, substraction we can
    compare things if two entities are same or not , if a number is greater than the other number or not.
    There are three main types of operators. They are Arithmetic operators, Relational operators and logical
    operators.

Arithmetic operators:
    We use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like additions, subtraction etc.
       + => Addition
       - => Subtraction
       / => Division
       * => Multiplication
       % => modulus , remainder

Relational Operators:
      Relation operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. - for ex. if something is bigger than
      other thing or if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same values or not.
     ==   => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if we get true otherwise we get false.
     !=   => used to check two variables don't contain the same value. We get a true if they are not the same .
      >   => used to check if one value is greater than other or not if greater - we get true.
      <   => used to check if the value on the left side is smaller than the value on right side - we will get a true.
     >=   =>if the values on left is greater than the value on right side or if they are same we will ge a true.
     <=   => it opposite of >= and it used to check if something is less than or equalty other thing.
Conditional constructs Java
ex.  Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition if condition is true that Java execute
    the code otherwise it skips that code.
    How to write IfElse conditions :
          if(condition) {
          } any line of code even another if condition
          if() {
          }

Important notes:
  1) For String we use equals method instead of == sign because it's a non-primitive data type
  2) We can cmd+opt+l(Mac) to format our code
  3) If we are confused about Brackets  we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part.


If Else conditions:
   When we have to test the same variable for multiple conditions I should use If else If
  When we have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other Nested if conditions
